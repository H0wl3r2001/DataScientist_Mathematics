# DataScientist_Mathematics

This is the first project which will be included in a portfolio-like website where I will compile knowledge about Data Science.

For this part, I start by introducing linear algebra concepts essential in the eyes of a Data Scientist. Then, going more in depth about Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, we explore the basis of PCA. Finally, by revising multivariate calculus, we introduce the concepts of gradients. We then use the latter to build a simple linear regression routine using gradient descent.

This project's themes are each expressed in a different Jupyter notebook, each having the concepts explained above and the references from which I supported the information provided. Furthermore, I provide with an environment **yml** extension file, to recreate the virtual Python environment where all Jupyter notebooks ran their code cells.
