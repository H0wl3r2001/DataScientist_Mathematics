Depending on the number of indexes, they can be a vector (1 index), matrix (2 indexes), and beyond the third-order tensors (3 indexes, where the 1st points to the row, 2nd to the column and 3rd to the axis), we have higher-order tensors. This makes them a generalization of the previous concepts. This is important for machine learning porpouses because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Representation**: Tensors are used to represent data in machine learning. For example, a color image can be represented as a 3-dimensional tensor with dimensions corresponding to height, width, and color channels (RGB).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Parameters**: In neural networks, tensors are used to represent the weights and biases of the model. These parameters are updated during the training process to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operations and Transformations**: Tensors allow for efficient mathematical operations and transformations. Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch are built around tensor operations, enabling efficient computation on GPUs and other hardware accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Batch Processing**: Tensors enable batch processing of data, which is essential for training machine learning models. By processing multiple data points simultaneously, tensors help in speeding up the training process.\n",

    "5. **Flexibility**: Tensors provide a flexible way to handle different types of data, including structured and unstructured data. This flexibility is crucial for building complex machine learning models that can handle diverse data sources.\n",
